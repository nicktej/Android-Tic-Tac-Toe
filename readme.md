# Tic Tac Toe

This is my first Android project, with guidance from professor Peter Ekler from AIT Budapest. It was mainly an exploration project, a dive into Android Development. The game allows two players to challenge one another over the same device, and has some creative backgrounds (bitmaps and shimmer texts). 

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

You will need Android Studio, and an emulator or an Android device.

### Installing

The only thing to note after downloading this is that some parts might be outdated, and the program was built with a specific package. You should probably change the manifest file.
